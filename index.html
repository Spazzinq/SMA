        <div class="main-line">
            <span class="lead-in">With the recent rise in social media usage</span><span class="mini-in"> and a bleak outlook for many Americans facing job losses, restricted social gatherings, and online-schooling, many people have turned to social media to soothe their mental stress and disconnect from the real world. But for some users, social media comes at a cost to their mental well-being through an addiction to it. <b>According to AddictionCenter, <a class="highlight" href="https://www.addictioncenter.com/drugs/social-media-addiction/" target="_blank">a clinically-reviewed guide to different types of addiction</a>, social media addiction (SMA) is a behavioral addiction characterized by “excessive or compulsive use” of social networking sites and applications.</b> Similar to substance use disorders, SMA symptoms include mood modification, salience, tolerance, withdrawal symptoms, conflict, and relapse. AddictionCenter estimates that <i>16 to 33 million Americans</i> meet the criteria for SMA today.

        <h1>WHY IS IT ADDICTING?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="text-section">
        <div class="main-line">
            <span class="lead-in">Computer addictions have existed</span><span class="mini-in"> since the early days of household computers, with the first scientific records posted <a class="highlight" href="https://doi.org/10.1089/cpb.1998.1.237" target="_blank">as long ago as 1998</a>. However, SMA is one of the first types of computer-related addiction to leverage different means to maintain control over users. There are two different causes for SMA: inherent and engineered factors. Inherent factors are the all-to-familiar, almost-natural reasons why people use social media:<br><br>
“It was because my friends were on it, and I wanted to connect with them.”<br>	
“Everyone I knew had one, so I decided to try it out.”<br>
“I wanted to meet new people.”<br><br>
Every reason follows one basic human necessity: <a class="highlight" href="https://gizmodo.com/why-is-social-media-so-addictive-1841261494" target="_blank"
>the need to belong</a>. People join social media to maintain contact with existing friends, to make new friends, or as a means to not miss out on what is happening (a.k.a. the fear of missing out, or FOMO). However, staying updated on daily occurrences and finding new friends can only go so far in terms of addiction. So, what could be the bigger reason? <b>Social media is designed to be intentionally addictive.</b>

    <div class="text-section">
        <div class="main-line">
            <span class="lead-in">There are many features</span><span class="mini-in"> that social media apps and websites use to make social media addicting (e.g. infinite scroll and video auto-play). However, those features are much more effective in conjunction with one feature in particular: <b>neural networks</b>. Neural networks are a part of a concept more generally known as <b>artificial intelligence</b>. You’ve probably heard of those words before, but do you know what they mean? Despite what you may think, understanding neural networks is fairly simple. Imagine for just a second that you are back in high school math (eww, I know).<br>
          <img src="resources/images/function.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;"><br>
          You are probably familiar with the concept of a function (e.g. f(x) = x<sup>2</sup>) and its three parts: the input (x), the relationship (the output is the input squared), and the output (x<sup>2</sup>). At some point, your teacher might have asked you to create a function by finding the relationship between inputs and outputs. Neural networks work nearly the same way. In the case of social media, machines are given input data about you — your age, your location, your friends, what is in a certain post, etc. — and they’re asked to find the relationship between that data and the output data — how long you look at a post. The computer uses an algorithm to guess the connection, and the resulting <b>relationship</b> between your data and your attention span is called a “neural network.” Then, social media companies use the neural network to guess what posts you will spend the most time looking at, and show you the ones that will <b>maximize</b> the time you spend on the app/website.

The number of ads they can show you is a simple relationship: <b>More time on app = More ads = More $$$</b>. The funny thing is, companies don’t even understand the relationships that computers draw between the data. They are willing to depend on technology that they do not fully understand. In other words, <a class="highlight" href="https://gizmodo.com/why-is-social-media-so-addictive-1841261494" target="_blank">“companies are becoming addicted (in terms of business success) to the very things that are addicting consumers.”</a>
