        <div class="main-line">
            <span class="lead-in">With the rise in social media usage</span><span class="mini-in"> and a bleak outlook for many Americans facing job losses, restricted social gatherings, and online-schooling, many people have turned to social media to soothe their mental stress and disconnect from the real world. But for some users, social media comes at a cost to their mental well-being through an addiction to it. According to AddictionCenter, a clinically-reviewed guide to different types of addiction, social media addiction (SMA) is a behavioral addiction characterized by “excessive or compulsive use” of social networking sites and applications. Similar to substance use disorders, SMA symptoms include mood modification, salience, tolerance, withdrawal symptoms, conflict, and relapse. Psychologists estimate that 16 to 33 million Americans meet the criteria for SMA today (Hilliard).

        <h1>WHY IS IT ADDICTING?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="text-section">
        <div class="main-line">
            <span class="lead-in">SMA is far from the only “cyber disorder.”</span><span class="mini-in"> Computer and Internet addictions have existed since the early days of household computers, with the first scientific records posted as long ago as 1998 (Young). However, SMA is one of the first types of computer-related addiction to leverage different means to maintain control over users. There are two different causes for SMA: <b>inherent and engineered factors</b>. 
Inherent factors are the all-to-familiar reasons why people use social media:
“It was because my friends were on it, and I wanted to connect with them.”	
“Everyone I knew had one, so I decided to try it out.”
“I wanted to meet new people.”
According to Pierre Berthon, Professor of Information Design at Bentley University, every reason followed one basic human necessity: the need to belong (Kolitz). People join social media to maintain contact with existing friends, to make new friends, or as a means to not miss out on what was happening (a.k.a. the fear of missing out). However, staying updated on daily occurrences and finding new friends can only go so far in terms of addiction. So, what is the bigger reason? Social media is designed to be <b>intentionally addictive</b>.

            <span class="lead-in">The best advice may not be what you want to hear,</span> <span class="mini-in">but according to the Center for Humane Technology, you should turn off social media application and website notifications (at least those that aren’t direct messages), and uninstall apps that “profit off of addiction, distraction, outrage, polarization, and misinformation” like Facebook, Tiktok, Snapchat, and Instagram. But for those who want to take it one step at a time, you can download tools to change your habits, reduce distractions, and stay focused on your goals. Finally, set boundaries for yourself: don’t use social media in the mornings, when you eat, or when you go to bed (“Take Control”).</span>
